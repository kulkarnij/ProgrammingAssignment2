## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## This is a collection of function that together offer a way to  speedup 
## repeated inversions of a matrix. Use makeCacheMatrix to create a cached matrix 
## from a matrix and cacheSolve to get its inverse. makeCacheMatrix assumes that the matrix 
## is invertible.
## matrices 

## Write a short comment describing this function
## Creates a cached matrix from a matrix that caches its inverse. 
## The matrix is assumed to be invertible. Inverse is created lazily
## when called the first time (lazy evaluation in R)

	inverse <- NULL
	set <- function(y) {
		x <<- y
	    m <<- NULL

	list (set = set, get = get,

## Write a short comment describing this function
## Returns the inverse of a matrix. The matrix must be invertible.
## Uses pre-made value if exits, computes it if it does not.

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inverse <- x$getinverse()
